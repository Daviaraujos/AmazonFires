# Amazon Fires Analysis
This project explores a dataset containing information about forest fires in the Amazon region. The dataset provides valuable insights into the frequency and intensity of fires reported over several years.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis includes details such as date, location, and the number of fires reported. With this data, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and trends associated with forest fires in the Amazon.

# Key Questions Explored
Temporal Trends: We investigate the variation in the number of reported fires over time, identifying any significant patterns by year, month, and day.

# Geographical Patterns
We analyze the spatial distribution of fires, exploring which states are most affected and if there are any discernible trends.

# Statistical Summary
We provide an overview of the statistical characteristics of the data, including measures of central tendency and dispersion.

# Comparative Analysis
We compare the occurrence of fires across different states and years to uncover potential insights.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Usage
Open the AmazonFires.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment.
Run each cell in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.
